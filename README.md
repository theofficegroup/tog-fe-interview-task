# tog-fe-interview-task

A repo to host all the assets you need for the Front-end interview task for TOG candidates.

## Intro

First of all, please clone or download this repository.

You will be fetching data on some of our workspaces (buildings) from an API and then using that data to recreate a responsive web page.

You will find screen designs at 3 different break points in the folder `./designs`.  The designs should match the following breakpoints:
-  `(min-width: 700px)`
-  `(min-width: 701px) and (max-width: 1220px)`
-  `(min-width: 1221px)`

You will find a typography guide in the location `./designs/Typography.png`.

All the assets you need to recreate the designs should be available in the folder `./assets`.

You can find a mock of the data that you will be retrieving in the folder `./mocks`.

Fetch our data from this endpoint - https://mocki.io/v1/0a8a3472-1336-467a-ae37-8ddf0edb26ae

## Task

Please set up a new public repository using your preferred service (github, gitlab, bitbucket, devops etc) and provide your solution as a React app (built with [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/)).

Make sure you commit changes regularly and add clear comments with each commit.

Please add a README.md with instructions on how to run your code.

> Bonus points if you deploy your solution to a static hosting provider!

Apart from the above you have total free range, so have some fun!

When you are ready, send a link to your repo back to the agency to share with TOG.

Please don't feel obliged to spend more than 3 hours on this - and don't worry if you don't finish, we can discuss what else you would have liked to do in the follow up interview.
